# CS50
A collection of projects, problem sets, and exercises completed as part of Harvard's CS50 course.

## Problem Set 0
### Scratch
- Started Week 0 with a basic idea of what coding entails and a basic intro to using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
- For the problem set, I had to implement any project of my choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or something else, subject to a few conditions.
- My Scratch project is a simple action game where
  - You use the **Up** and **Down arrow keys** to move Deadpool.
  - You press **Spacebar** to shoot bullets.
  - If Wolverine reaches Deadpool or the left edge, he wins.
  - If you score 10 hits, Deadpool wins!
