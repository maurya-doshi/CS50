# CS50
A collection of projects, problem sets, and exercises completed as part of Harvard's CS50 course.

## Problem Set 0

### Scratch
- Started Week 0 with a basic idea of what coding entails and a basic intro to using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
- For the problem set, I had to implement any project of my choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or something else, subject to a few conditions.
- My Scratch project is a simple action game where
  - You use the **Up** and **Down arrow keys** to move Deadpool.
  - You press **Spacebar** to shoot bullets.
  - If Wolverine reaches Deadpool or the left edge, he wins.
  - If you score 10 hits, Deadpool wins!


## Problem Set 1

### Hello, It's Me
- Started with the basics of file and directory creation in the codespace.
- Wrote a simple C program that prompts the user for their name and outputs "Hello, <name>"

### Mario (Less)
- Implemented a C program that takes user input for the height of a right-aligned pyramid and prints it using # symbols.

### Mario (More)
- Extended the previous program to print two pyramids of the same height facing opposite directions with a two-space gap between them.
- Added an input constraint to only accept numbers between 1 and 8 (inclusive).

### Cash
- Wrote a C program that simulates a cashier that
  - Asks the user for an amount in cnets
  - Outputs the minimum number of coins needed (25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢) using a greedy algorithm.

### Credit
- Wrote a C program to validate credit card numbers using Luhn’s Algorithm
  - Checks whether the card is Visa, Mastercard, American Express (AMEX), or Invalid based on length and starting digits.
